# C-Battleship-Game
Text-based battleship using C language.

/* A personal representation of the board game battleship, but in C! Ships will need to be created and placed onto a standard
grid by the users. Ship length, orientation, and size is customizable, and will depend on the users. Remember to have an equal
number of ships to make the game fair!

The use of a C compiler (i.e. GCC, clang, etc.) is required.
In terminal, go to directory of the battleship file and create an executable (i.e. gcc Battleship.c -o play).
Then in terminal, type "./play" to play the game!

Any advice or comments are welcomed! */
